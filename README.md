Textsive

### A jQuery plugin for creating responsive container filling text.

Very often in graphic design the urge to stack words arises and you want that stack to be nice and square. Such was the case with Midnight and Viking. How do I get the bottom 6 letters to scale up and fill the same space as the top 8 without a whole bunch of styles AND keep it responsive? Well this plugin is that answer. 

### For an example and to play with it some you can check out the example here:
